# Project Structure
* `public/`: this folder contains the index.html file where the compiled Javascript is included, and also where you can tweak the page attributes, such as the title, attribute, favicon, and many other. You can also add assets such as images here, but we recommend including assets via the import feature from the src/ folder;
* `src/`: in this folder most of the code will be located as it is the source of the application. Assets, components, data, pages, routing, and even the stylesheets can be found here;
* `src/assets/`: this is the folder where you should include images, fonts, and any other static assets that you’ll be importing into your app;
* `src/components/`: in this folder we recommend building new components that you will use as UI elements throughout your project;
* `src/data/`: this is the folder where the data should come from. The data folder should contain the API calls for the backend of your application;
* `src/pages/`: this folder contains the pages of your application which are registered as routes in the routes.js file;
* `src/scss/`: here you can write and modify the stylesheet of your application, but also change the Sass variables and mixins to easily change the appearance of the project seamlessly;
* `src/index.js`: this is the main wrapper file where the routing and the base layout of the project is sticked together;
* `src/routes.js`: this is the file where you first declare the routes of the application, and later register in the Homepage.js component which will render from the index.js file;
* `package.json`: this is an important file that contains the project dependencies, the base URL for the project when building the production code, and also some useful scripts that you can use via NPM;
* `node_modules/`: this is the folder where all dependencies will be installed after running yarn install;

## Tools ##
- File sharing
- Messaging
- Issue shares
  - For us: (all this assuming they log in with a hardware wallet)
    - transfer request for issuer account to send shares to destination
      - build txn where BT_ISSUER sends shares to destination
      - set memo (required) with constraint limit checking for byte size
      - sign transaction locally with issuer treasury account
        - CSV uploads for bulk payroll ops
      - blockchain details thereunder:
        - issuer treasury account is part of omnibus muxed BT_ISSUER signer
        - muxed account has weight below min_thresh and can combine with server key to effect issue
        - server looks up specific treasury account signer referenced from mux
        - gets the company treasury address and resolves the stock they represent
        - for new issues: send out new issue based on memo formatted as [amountUnrestrictedMainStock]|federationAddr
          - this works since restricted employee grants come from the plan holdings or direct treasury
      - send to server which validates signature
      - if valid, server signs and issues
        - safe b/c only works if hardware signs
- Deposit/withdraw from broker (for us: perhaps redundant and ignore given auto DWAC via SEP6/FIRE server)
- Import list of brokerage investors to add to DRS dataset for analytics (future feature?)

## Help ##
- FAQs
- Guides
- Support communication

## Governance ##
- Generate insider trading report
- Board communications
  - Upload annual report
  - Upload proxy statement
  - New special meeting
- Global entity share management (Board spread across var. firms)

## Settings ## 
- Manage company information
- §270.17a-7 transactions (from Treasury)
- Manage affiliates
- Access users
  - Should be able to search through their shareholders to add someone as an access user (tbd, hardware auth here vs app access)
  - e.g. they could get a popup on their phone app, and review/sign everything with their local key
  - circle around on this once Vikas plays around more with hardware auth

## Future Desired Things ##
- Stock options
- Vesting data
- Investors to have accounts they can log in on an app to see share balances / vesting schedule & history
- Easy TA support so that the investors don't call the company

## Affiliate Voting
- implement the transfer server and credentials updates via lambda calls with the actual pii easily dispersed in dynamo
- For counting affiliate votes, we can also do indefinite returnable CBs from AFF*affiliate.holdings to AFFs (which net to zero in affiliate.holdings), and the issuer could easily manage changes on that side themselves (to/from brokers with auto-rep letters) for Rule 144/Section 10 reporting on their side themselves (prevents us from needing their CCC)
- (parallel to scanning for standard avaliable to claim restricted stock which is legally granted and votable) (edited) 
- (but still have automatic purchase statement/notifications for insider buys)
- (where you have firm affiliations internal as a secondary dynamo index for balance check sweeps and pings at time of purchase or transfer gift per rolling week to check for misses into AFF CBs)
