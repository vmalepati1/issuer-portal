## Tools ##
- File sharing
- Messaging
- Issue shares
  - For us: (all this assuming they log in with a hardware wallet)
    - transfer request for issuer account to send shares to destination
      - build txn where BT_ISSUER sends shares to destination
      - set memo (required) with constraint limit checking for byte size
      - sign transaction locally with issuer treasury account
        - CSV uploads for bulk payroll ops
      - blockchain details thereunder:
        - issuer treasury account is part of omnibus muxed BT_ISSUER signer
        - muxed account has weight below min_thresh and can combine with server key to effect issue
        - server looks up specific treasury account signer referenced from mux
        - gets the company treasury address and resolves the stock they represent
        - for new issues: send out new issue based on memo formatted as [amountUnrestrictedMainStock]|federationAddr
          - this works since restricted employee grants come from the plan holdings or direct treasury
      - send to server which validates signature
      - if valid, server signs and issues
        - safe b/c only works if hardware signs
- Deposit/withdraw from broker (for us: perhaps redundant and ignore given auto DWAC via SEP6/FIRE server)
- Import list of brokerage investors to add to DRS dataset for analytics (future feature?)
